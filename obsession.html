<h1>My obsession</h1>Hello, my name is Georgina and I will be talking about my obsession. My obsession is playing soccer. 
I've been playing soccer since I was in 6th grade. I started playing because my older brother would play and seeing him play 
made me want to do it as well. Since then I played for school my 8th grade year up until now. Playing soccer makes me happy and
makes me feel at peace.
