            <h1>Welcome to the Second Page!</h1>
            <p>Hi this is my second page where I would like to talk more about myself. I was born December 9th 2007. I am on my last year of high school 
                and am deyond excited. I moved to shafter my 8th grade year and at first I disliked it so much. I missed my old school and friends. I used 
                to live in Wasco so when I moved everything was completely different. I used to play soccer for Wasco and now I was playing for our rivals.
                It felt so werid but overtime I enjoyed playing for Shafter. I loved all the new people I had meet and all my new friends.            
            </p>
